The Online Bus  Reservation System is a web-based application that allows visitors check bus ticket availability, buy bus ticket and pay the bus ticket online . This system is established for all the home/office users after gaining access from the administrator. According to Invaderzim (2011), Online Bus Reservation System provides bus transportation system, a facility to reserved seats, cancellation of seats and different types of enquiry which need an instant and quick reservation. This system can be used by the users in performing online reservation via internet for their all business purposes. Users can use this program directly on their websites and no need to install it. The use of bus traveling is a large growing business in Bangladesh and other countries; hence bus reservation system deals with maintenance of records of each passenger who had reserved a seat for a journey. It also includes maintenance of information like schedule and details of each bus (Shivaji, 2010). Also, we get to know that there are many operations, which they have to do manually. It takes a lot of time and causes many errors. Due to this, sometimes a lot of problems occur and they were facing many disputes with customers. To solve the above problem, and further maintaining records of items, seat availability for customers, price of per seat, bill generation and other things, we are offering this proposal of reservation system. The reservation system has three modules. First module helps the customer to enquire the availability of seats in a particular bus at particular date, the second module helps him to reserve a ticket and with the third module he can cancel a reserved ticket. However, since the current reservation system is still conducted manually and separately at each branch, contact must be made by each branch’s front-officer to the head office for each customer’s enquiry in order to get the latest update on schedule, seat availability and other reservation-related information; as well as to avoid duplicate bookings or over-capacity.
